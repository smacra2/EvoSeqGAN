# GANs for Simulating DNA Sequence Evolution

GAN-based approach to simulating sequence evolution: A generative adversarial network that trains the two models above in concert, such that the generator ultimately creates seemingly real sequence pairs (i.e. sequence pairs undistinguishable from the real dataset).

# Data 

The sequence alignment maf files are available at http://repo.cs.mcgill.ca/PUB/blanchem/Boreoeutherian/ download the maf files and put it under the 'data' directory.

The tree structure and nomenclature for species are available at http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg38/multiz100way/hg38.100way.nh

The ancestral sequences are labelled as (First character seq1)(First character seq2), so the most recent common ancestor of hp38 and pantro4 will be HP.
